New Item Setup & Launch Guardian
Advancing CPG through Forensic-Grade Automation
I’m Jenica, a 15+ year CPG veteran, and I provide Fractional Sales Ops & Retail Strategy helping high-growth brands navigate the jump from specialty to national distribution without adding a $150k+ executive headcount.

🎯 The Mission
"My mission is to empower legacy and emerging brands by modernizing the manual friction that holds them back. I bridge the gap between traditional brand values and forward-thinking execution, transforming 'the way it’s always been done' into a precision growth engine. Your focus should be on your products and people—not the administrative burden."

🛠 The Problem: Manual Friction in Scaling
The transition from specialty to national retail is often hampered by "manual mess." Brands lose critical momentum during the first 90 days due to:

Administrative Overload: Manually filling out hundreds of complex retail item setup forms.

Portal Blind Spots: Not knowing exactly when or where an item has successfully gone "live" in retail systems.

Delayed Visibility: Failing to catch velocity trends or distribution gaps until it's too late to save the launch.

🚀 The Solution: The Launch Guardian
The New Item Setup & Launch Guardian is an automated agentic framework designed to provide forensic-grade oversight from form generation to the final day of the launch window.

Core Capabilities
1. Automated Item Setup Generation
What it does: Automates the generation of complex, retailer-specific item setup forms.

The Benefit: Eliminates the manual "grunt work" and human error associated with data entry, ensuring 100% accuracy for national distribution launches.

2. Setup Completion & Portal Audits
What it does: Acts as a real-time guardrail that verifies item setup status across disparate retail portals.

The Benefit: Instantly flags "voids" or delayed setups, preventing lost sales days before the product even hits the shelf.

3. The "First 90 Days" Velocity Tracker
What it does: Provides automated monitoring of performance benchmarks during the critical 90-day launch window.

The Benefit: Moves the needle by identifying real-time growth opportunities and shifts in consumer behavior immediately.

📊 Strategic Impact
By synthesizing internal sales data with external retail portal feedback, this tool enables:

Legacy Preservation: Respects the foundations that built the brand while installing the technology needed to protect its future.

Data Action over Data Cleaning: Teams stop "cleaning" reports and start acting on real-time insights.

Scalable Infrastructure: Senior-level retail operations execution without the $150k+ executive headcount.
